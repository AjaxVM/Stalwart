Project Stalwart it is an attempt to create a uniform framework for websites.
Currently, it is just my random thoughts trying things until I figure out what works.


The front-end will be a simple library on top of jQuery that provides
some of the best features of other frameworks, but without the size or bloat.

For instance, two-way binding, event-watching, classes with multiple inheritance, etc.

On the backend is Python using Django.
The Django models define how fields should be validated and converted to JSON for the front-end.
