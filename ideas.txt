Currently we are having a slight issue where sometimes sW.Defaults is not loading.
I think it is transient and due to the local file testing we have at present, but need to keep an eye on it.
It happens a lot after multiple page refreshes - not sure why the define from Defaults is not setting it loaded before it loads utils


Change how classes work to use prototyping under the hood
Pass in an object with values/functions that are then assigned as prototypes.
Anything you inherit will have wrapper functions created that apply that function (with arguments) - and you can overwrite and reference back with Parent.prototype.call(this, **args);
